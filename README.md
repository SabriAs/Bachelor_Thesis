Bachelor Thesis - Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain and Logistics
This thesis aims to reflect the current state of research around the blockchain technology in the logistics sector and supply chain. 
To this end, the general state of development on the topic of the blockchain technology will be systematically examined. 
Subsequently, various blockchain-based concepts, especially for the exchange of valuable information in the logistics sector and the supply chain, 
are to be critically analysed and compared with already existing approaches. 
Finally, based on the analysis, the potential benefits, as well as the limitations and challenges of the blockchain impact on the logistics industry, 
are to be examined and constructively discussed.
